[f 2 1][bup 6 1 65535 65535 0 0]I know people say sugar is bad for you, but there are some health benefits.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][f 4 23 0 6 0 25 25]In fact, glucose is an essential source of fuel for your brain.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0]It's caused by low levels of glucose, which makes your blood sugar drop.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 3 65535 65535 0 0][f 4 23 0 6 3 25 25]I thought that, if you had similar tastes in food, I could make you lunch sometime, but...[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 3 65535 65535 0 0]To be honest, I'm a bit like that, too. I'm only interested in cooking food.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][f 4 23 0 6 0 25 25]You know how some people would stand in line for hours just to buy some popular desserts?[n][w][e]
