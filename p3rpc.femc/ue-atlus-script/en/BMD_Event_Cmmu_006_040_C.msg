[f 2 1]Do you really need one?[e]
[f 2 1]Start with the basics first.[e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 6 0 0]...Yes, you're right.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 7 0 0]I haven't even gotten the basics down yet. I'm getting way too ahead of myself.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 6 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 13 0 0]Hmm, let me think...[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 6 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 14 0 0]Well, I guess I'm a little handy with machines.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 3 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 19 0 0]I guess I'm sort of good with machines, but that's it, really.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 23 0 0]I mean, everyone in our group works hard.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 29 0 0]When I was little, I remember my dad's hobby was to work on complicated sound equipment.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 30 0 0]He'd fix things like broken amplifiers, or headphones that only played sound on one side.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 31 0 0]I've always loved watching him work on those things.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 32 0 0]That's probably why I was drawn to working with machines in the first place.[n][w][e]

[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 33 0 0]But, I don't think that would be very useful to repay everyone's kindness.[n][w][e]
[f 2 1][bup 6 0 65535 65535 0 0][vp 1 0 0 34 0 0]Plus, if we do ever have any technical needs, like when we're fighting, then we've always got the Kirijo Group's support.[n][w][e]

[sel SEL_015_0_0 top]
